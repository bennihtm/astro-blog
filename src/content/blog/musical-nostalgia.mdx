While I was walking home today, I was listening to music when this song came on:

<YouTube id="-QU-gLzxLx0" />

As I was listening, I felt nostalgia. 
Martian Party wasn't a particularly old song in my mind but it was one of the first songs I ever listened to from Matthew Parker.

If I had to guess, I would have said the song released in 2016. I associate a time with the song where I previously didn't really listen to music - and as dumb as that sounds - my brother introduced me to it.
He showed me a lot of good artists - Matthew Parker, Capital Kings - and I kind of "copied" his tastes in music.

Turns out, the song released in 2021.
Apparently, I have no sense of time.

For some reason I find this incredibly interesting.
