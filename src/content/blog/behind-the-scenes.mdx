I am a doubter. 

I doubt everything. 

But mostly myself.

Am I good enough? Will I make it? What are the others thinking of me? Did what I just said sound stupid? *Can everyone see that I'm full of fear?*

So I started building an idol, someone I aspire to be, but I am not.
I started to make that my own, pretending that I am.

But, *what if*, all that came crumbling down?

My idol is falling. It is no more.

The emptiness reveals *my fear*.

But that's not the only thing that's left. Next to my fear are *you*, *God*. There, next to the ashes of my idol. Standing, pointing out the footsteps. *Your* footsteps, leading my way.
Even in my darkest moments, in the moments where fear was my master. I thought so, at least.
You were the one who laid out my path the whole time. There.

It didn't, and it doesn't matter what I did, what I thought, how stupid I was.

It's not of importance how far I removed myself from you with my thoughts, with my actions.

**You never left**.
