Hey! üëã I don't know you found this, but still, welcome to my little place on the internet!

I'm Benjamin as you might have guessed, and I write stuff. Sometimes it's [software](https://github.com/benjaminwolkchen) and other times it's devotions, short texts and poetry for [awesomeBible](https://awesomebible.de).

That's me and my nephew üòç:

<Image src={me} width={300} height={300} alt="A picture of me holding a baby." />

Another kind of important fact about me: I'm a Christian. I believe that I am a nobody and I can't live without the *mad* Grace of God.

My interests include photography (some of my photos you can find on here), self-hosting and server administration, web development and open source software in general. By the way, this blog is also [open source](https://github.com/benjaminwolkchen/astro-blog) - built with [Astro](https://astro.build).

If you want to contact me for some reason, you can find my contact information on the [About](/about) page. Also, if you are searching for the old blog posts that I've written, take a look [here](https://old.bendaha.eu.org).

Thank you for reading this and have an amazing day!
