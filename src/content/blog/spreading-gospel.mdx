Some christians are saying that we should actively go out and evangelize, others don't want to do that, because they don't want to force their religion onto other people.

I think we are commanded to do so [in the bible](https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV/Mark16,15), but we should be careful on *how* we do that.

## What we *shouldn't do*
I hope this dis already clear, but here it goes anyway: 
- We shouldn't force our point onto other people, 
- we shouldn't annoy them, 
- we shouldn't just pass out flyers or tracts.

## What we can do
The simplest thing we all can do is just being friendly and letting Jesus' love shine through us.
> By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.
> ~ [John 13,35](https://www.bibleserver.com/ESV/John13%3A35)

We can be there for other people, motivating them and sharing the experiences that we had in our faith journey.

And I get that talking isn't for everyone and it can seem scary, there are plenty of other ways to share **the** most important message on planet earth.
We can share music that has christian lyrics or just a christian core, poetry, books.

We're able to send a message, or spark a conversation - well, then we're just back to point one - with how we dress.

We can wear a boring green t-shirt or we can wear this: <small>(not sponsored)</small>

Not only is the little ghost cute, it can also spark conversation about ghosts. Which is exactly what we want. ðŸ«°
