I feel like blogging has become a chore for me. Besides several other things going on in my life, blogging has felt tedious for me. I wanna write stuff that has high quality and offers something to the reader.

Well. Not anymore, dear reader. :) From now on, I'm just gonna write what comes to my mind, if it has value to you, I'm very happy. If not, well, I am still very happy, because it has value to me.

To at least offer a bit of value (does this man even listen to himself?), this is a song that I've been listening to non-stop since it came out (today):

Also, the rss feed is currently broken, so... Sorry...
